Ramsay FY24 shows operational resilience, with earnings supported by strong patient growth: Ramsay delivered a solid full-year result, with revenue reaching 16.8 billion dollars, up 5.4% on a constant currency basis. Underlying net profit from continuing operations rose by 10.7% compared to the previous year, at 158.9 million dollars. While cost pressures from wage growth and slower price increases in Europe continued to weigh on margins, stronger patient volumes in Australia and a recovery in the UK helped offset these challenges. The final dividend of 40 cents per share lifted the total annual dividend to 80 cents, a 6.7% increase.
Operational investments targeting long-term uplift: Ramsay allocated 286 million dollars in FY24 to strategic capital projects, new greenfield developments and adjacent service expansion across Australia and the UK. The focus remains on scaling its integrated care model, with growing emphasis on mental health, diagnostics and out-of-hospital services. These areas are aligned with shifting patient needs and help reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and free up critical resources for more urgent and complex care.
Workforce and retention remain critical enablers: With workforce shortages and wage inflation continuing to pressure the sector, Ramsay is focusing on developing and retaining its staff over the long term. Its “grow our own” strategy is being rolled out through expanded graduate intakes and leadership development under the Global Leadership Academy. These initiatives are critical to stabilising workforce availability and ensuring Ramsay can sustainably meet rising demand while maintaining service quality across its network.
